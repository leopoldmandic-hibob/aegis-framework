# Feature-Based Structure Migration Summary

## Migration Date
$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

## What Changed

### New Structure
- Created `features/` directory for feature-specific contexts
- Created `common/` directory for shared resources
- Added feature management operations
- Updated templates for feature support

### Content Migration
- Existing tasks moved to `common/tasks/`
- Global memory moved to `common/memory/`
- Project plan moved to `common/plan/`
- Sessions moved to `common/sessions/`
- Decisions moved to `common/decisions/`

### New Capabilities
- Feature creation: `/aegis feature create <name>`
- Feature listing: `/aegis feature list`
- Feature status: `/aegis feature status <name>`
- Feature-scoped operations with `--feature` flag

## Next Steps

1. **Analyze existing tasks** to determine feature assignment
2. **Create features** for major components
3. **Move tasks** to appropriate features
4. **Update references** to use new namespacing
5. **Remove old structure** after verification

## Backward Compatibility

The old structure is preserved in:
- Backup: `$(basename $BACKUP_DIR)`
- Original directories still exist (will be removed after full migration)

## Important Notes

- All existing commands work with `common/`
- New `--feature` flag enables feature-specific operations
- References need updating to include feature namespacing
- Review `common/` regularly to move items to features
