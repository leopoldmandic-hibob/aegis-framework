# Self-Improvement Analysis

## Overview
The self-improvement analysis is a core component of the Aegis framework that enables continuous improvement through systematic analysis of project patterns, task execution, and decision-making processes. This feature is integrated into the existing framework operations and memory structure.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Single Data File
All self-improvement data is stored in a single `self_improvement.json` file in the project memory, containing:
- Insights (process, efficiency, patterns, blockers)
- Metrics (time allocation, task completion, decision metrics)
- Patterns (task, decision, session)
- Recommendations (process, efficiency, risk)
- History (analysis records)

### 2. Session Integration
Self-improvement insights are embedded directly in session files:
- A dedicated "Self-Improvement" section in each session
- Key insights and recommendations highlighted
- Metrics summarized for quick reference

### 3. Operation Integration
The feature is integrated with minimal changes to existing operations:
- `/aegis save`: Generates and stores insights
- `/aegis start`: Applies relevant recommendations
- `/aegis task`: Leverages pattern data

### Session Format

# Session 2025-03-08

## Overview

## Progress

## Decisions
...

## Self-Improvement
### Insights
- Documentation tasks consistently take 30% longer than initially estimated
- Tasks with more than 2 dependencies have a 60% chance of being moved to hold status

### Metrics
- Task completion rate: 75% (3/4 planned tasks completed)
- Time allocation: implementation: 55%, planning: 20%, documentation: 15%, debugging: 10%
- Decision efficiency: 2 key decisions made, both implemented successfully

### Recommendations
- [High priority] Start each session with a 10-minute planning period to improve task completion rates
- [Medium priority] Allocate 30% more time for documentation tasks than initially estimated
- [Low priority] Review tasks with more than 2 dependencies before starting to reduce hold transitions

## Analysis Process

### 1. Data Collection
During the `/aegis save` operation, the framework collects:
- Current session information
- Task history and transitions
- Decision records
- Time allocation across activities

### 2. Analysis Categories
The analysis covers:
- Process analysis (workflow patterns, bottlenecks)
- Efficiency analysis (time allocation, completion rates)
- Pattern recognition (recurring behaviors)
- Blocker identification (obstacles, resolution strategies)

### 3. Insight Generation
Based on the analysis, the framework generates:
- Process insights
- Efficiency insights
- Pattern insights
- Blocker insights

### 4. Recommendation Formation
The framework forms actionable recommendations:
- Process improvements
- Efficiency enhancements
- Risk mitigations

### 5. Storage and Integration
Insights and recommendations are:
- Stored in the `self_improvement.json` file
- Included in the session log
- Applied to future operations

## Validation

### Validation Schema
A comprehensive validation schema is defined in `self_improvement_validation.json` to ensure data integrity and proper integration:

- **Data Validation**: Ensures the `self_improvement.json` file adheres to the required structure
- **Session Validation**: Verifies that session documents contain properly formatted Self-Improvement sections
- **Analysis Validation**: Confirms that the analysis process meets minimum requirements for insight generation
- **Integration Validation**: Ensures proper integration with framework operations

### Validation Process
The validation occurs at multiple points:

1. **Pre-Analysis**: Validates input data before analysis begins
2. **Post-Analysis**: Validates generated insights and recommendations
3. **Integration Check**: Verifies proper integration with session documents
4. **Operation Validation**: Ensures operations correctly handle self-improvement data

### Error Handling
When validation fails, the framework:
1. Logs the specific validation error
2. Attempts recovery based on the error type
3. Falls back to safe defaults if recovery fails
4. Ensures core operations continue even if self-improvement analysis is incomplete

## Usage

### Accessing Insights
- Review the "Self-Improvement" section in session logs
- Examine the `self_improvement.json` file for detailed data

### Applying Recommendations
- Consider recommendations at session start
- Apply suggested improvements incrementally
- Track the impact of implemented recommendations

### Interpreting Insights
- Process insights highlight workflow patterns
- Efficiency insights focus on productivity
- Pattern insights identify recurring behaviors
- Blocker insights highlight obstacles

## Implementation Notes

1. All timestamps use the format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
2. Confidence values range from 0.0 to 1.0
3. Impact levels: low, medium, high
4. Recommendation status: pending, implemented, rejected
5. IDs follow the pattern TYPE-XXX (e.g., INSIGHT-001, REC-001)
6. Self-improvement section is a required part of all session documents
7. Validation ensures data integrity across the framework
