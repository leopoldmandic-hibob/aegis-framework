# Session Update Triggers
# This file defines trigger events that prompt session updates at meaningful points
# rather than arbitrary intervals, optimizing documentation and performance.

    priority: medium
    
  time_based:
    description: "Time-based triggers (used sparingly)"
    detection:
      - pattern: "30+ minutes since last session update"
      - pattern: "significant work without session update"
    prompt: "We've been working for a while without updating the session document. Would you like to save our progress now?"
    priority: low
    
  context_switch:
    description: "Switching focus to a different area"
    detection:
      - pattern: "switching focus to"
      - pattern: "moving on to"
      - pattern: "changing focus from [A] to [B]"

implementation:
  detection_process:

    - check_task_state: "Monitor task state changes"
    - track_progress: "Track completed steps and milestones"
    - measure_time: "Track time since last session update"

    - handle_response: "Process user response (yes/no)"
    
  update_process:
    - if_approved:
      - update_session: "Update session document with progress"
      - confirm_update: "Confirm update to user"
    - if_declined:
      - note_preference: "Note user preference"
      - continue_work: "Continue with current task"

best_practices:
  - prioritize_meaningful_events: "Focus on significant milestones over minor updates"
  - avoid_interruption: "Don't interrupt user flow for minor updates"
  - combine_triggers: "Combine multiple triggers into a single update suggestion"
  - respect_preferences: "Learn from user responses to refine trigger sensitivity"
  - provide_context: "Include specific progress details in update suggestions"
  - balance_frequency: "Avoid too frequent or too sparse update suggestions"
