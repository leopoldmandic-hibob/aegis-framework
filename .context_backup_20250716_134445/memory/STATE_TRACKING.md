# Memory State Tracking

## Overview
The state tracking system maintains consistency across the framework's memory system by tracking changes, validating updates, and ensuring proper state transitions.

## State Types

### Document States
1. Task States
   - planned → active: Task started
   - active → completed: Task finished
   - active → hold: Task paused
   - hold → active: Task resumed
   
2. Session States
   - created → active: Session started
   - active → paused: Work paused
   - paused → active: Work resumed
   - active → completed: Session ended

3. Decision States
   - draft → review: Ready for review
   - review → accepted/rejected: Decision made
   - rejected → draft: Revision needed

### Memory States
1. Core Memory
   - read-only: Framework rules
   - mutable: Framework state
   - configurable: Settings

2. Project Memory
   - append-only: Decisions
   - mutable: Context
   - cumulative: Progress

3. Session Memory
   - volatile: Active state
   - persistent: History
   - temporary: Cache

## State Changes

### Change Types
1. Direct Changes
   - Document status updates
   - Configuration changes
   - User preferences

2. Indirect Changes
   - Reference updates
   - Dependency changes
   - State propagation

3. System Changes
   - Framework updates
   - Session transitions
   - Cleanup operations

### Change Rules
1. Validation
   - Check state transition allowed
   - Verify references valid
   - Ensure consistency

2. Updates
   - Record timestamp
   - Update references
   - Maintain history

3. Propagation
   - Update dependencies
   - Notify related items
   - Maintain consistency

## Implementation

### State Tracking
1. Document Level
   ```yaml
   status: current_state
   updated: timestamp
   history:
     - state: previous_state
       timestamp: when_changed
       reason: why_changed
   ```

2. Memory Level
   ```yaml
   type: memory_type
   state: current_state
   content: memory_data
   metadata:
     created: creation_time
     updated: last_update
     history: state_changes
   ```

### State Operations
1. Read State
   - Check permissions
   - Load current state
   - Validate schema

2. Update State
   - Verify transition
   - Record change
   - Update timestamps

3. Track History
   - Save previous state
   - Record reason
   - Maintain log

## Usage Rules

### State Access
1. Read Operations
   - Always check current state
   - Verify permissions
   - Validate schema

2. Write Operations
   - Follow state transitions
   - Update all references
   - Maintain history

3. Update Operations
   - Check transition allowed
   - Record change reason
   - Update dependencies

### Recovery Procedures
1. State Mismatch
   - Load last valid state
   - Check history log
   - Resolve conflicts

2. Failed Updates
   - Revert to previous
   - Log failure reason
   - Retry if safe

3. Inconsistencies
   - Detect conflicts
   - Resolve references
   - Rebuild state
