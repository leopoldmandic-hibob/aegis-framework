## Context
The framework needs a reliable system for storing and managing different types of memory, including framework state, project context, and session information. The implementation choice will affect all framework operations.

## Problem Statement
We need to choose an implementation approach for the memory system that ensures data consistency, provides easy access, and maintains reliability across all framework operations.

## Drivers
- Data consistency is critical
- Must support multiple memory types
- Need concurrent access
- Must be reliable and recoverable
- Should be easy to debug

## Options Considered
### Option 1: File-based YAML Storage
- Pros
  - Human-readable format
  - Easy to version control
  - Simple to implement
  - Good tooling support
- Cons
  - Slower than binary formats
  - No built-in transactions
  - Needs careful concurrent access

### Option 2: SQLite Database
- Pros
  - ACID compliance
  - Better performance
  - Built-in concurrent access
  - Transaction support
- Cons
  - Less transparent
  - Harder to version control
  - Requires migration system
  - More complex implementation

## Decision
Implement a file-based system using YAML format with additional safeguards:
1. Use atomic writes for updates
2. Implement transaction logging
3. Add file locking for concurrent access
4. Create backup system

## Rationale
- YAML format provides better transparency
- File-based system works well with git
- Atomic writes ensure consistency
- Transaction logs enable recovery
- Simpler to implement and maintain

## Implementation
- [x] Create directory structure
- [x] Define memory types
- [ ] Implement atomic writes
- [ ] Add transaction logging
- [ ] Create utility functions
- [ ] Add backup system

## Consequences
### Positive
- Easy to inspect and debug
- Works well with version control
- Simple to understand
- Easy to modify

### Negative
- Slower than database
- Manual concurrent access
- More code for safety
- Need careful error handling
