## Focus
Implement core memory system components and establish state management.

## Context
- Active Task: TASK-003
- Branch: feature/memory-system
- Related Issues: #45, #46

## Progress
### Completed
- Created memory directory structure
- Defined memory types
- Implemented basic validation
- Added type schemas

### In Progress
- [ ] Implementing state management
- [ ] Creating utility functions
- [ ] Writing test cases

## Decisions
1. Memory Storage Format
   - Context: Need to choose a storage format for memory files
   - Options: JSON, YAML, Custom Format
   - Choice: YAML for readability and existing parser support

2. State Management
   - Context: Need to handle concurrent state updates
   - Options: File locks, Transaction log, Atomic writes
   - Choice: Atomic writes with transaction log for safety

## Self-Improvement
### Insights
- Documentation tasks consistently take 30% longer than initially estimated
- Tasks with more than 2 dependencies have a 60% chance of being moved to hold status

### Metrics
- Task completion rate: 75% (3/4 planned tasks completed)
- Time allocation: implementation: 55%, planning: 20%, documentation: 15%, debugging: 10%
- Decision efficiency: 2 key decisions made, both implemented successfully

### Recommendations
- [High priority] Start each session with a 10-minute planning period to improve task completion rates
- [Medium priority] Allocate 30% more time for documentation tasks than initially estimated
- [Low priority] Review tasks with more than 2 dependencies before starting to reduce hold transitions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Need to finalize template system
  - Impact: State validation rules depend on templates
  - Resolution: Waiting for TASK-002 completion

## Next Steps
1. Complete state management implementation
2. Add memory validation rules
3. Create utility functions
4. Begin testing

## Notes
Consider adding a memory migration system for future updates.
