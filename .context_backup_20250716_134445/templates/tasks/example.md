## Description
Create a robust memory system for storing and managing framework state, project context, and session information using a file-based approach.

## Objectives
- Create memory storage structure
- Implement memory types
- Add state management
- Ensure data consistency

## Steps
- [x] Design memory directory structure
- [x] Define memory types and schemas
- [ ] Implement state management
- [ ] Add validation rules
- [ ] Create memory utilities
- [ ] Test memory operations

## Progress
- Completed memory system design
- Created directory structure
- Defined core memory types:
  - Framework memory
  - Project memory
  - Session memory
- Implemented basic validation

## Dependencies
- TASK-001: Framework structure 
- TASK-002: Document templates 

## Notes
Memory system must be reliable and maintain consistency across all operations.
Consider implementing backup and recovery mechanisms.

## Next Steps
1. Implement state management system
2. Create memory validation rules
3. Build utility functions
4. Add test cases
