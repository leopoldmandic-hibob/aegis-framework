## What is Aegis?

Aegis is a powerful framework that combines AI capabilities with structured project management to help teams build better software. It provides:

- ü§ñ AI-assisted project planning and execution
- üìã Structured task management
- üß† Intelligent memory system
- üîÑ State tracking and validation
- üìù Comprehensive documentation

## Collaborative Philosophy

Aegis is built on a collaborative philosophy where humans and AI work together with a shared understanding of principles and practices. This is reflected in our documentation approach:

- **Best Practices Documents**: Serve a dual purpose - they guide Aegis's behavior and provide reference for human collaboration
- **Shared Understanding**: The framework creates an environment where humans and AI operate from the same playbook
- **Transparent Operation**: Documentation explains not just what to do, but why and how Aegis approaches different aspects of project management

For more details on this collaborative approach, see [Understanding Best Practices in the Aegis Framework](https://buildsomething.ai/aegis/user-guide/best-practices-purpose/).

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Planning
Let AI help you break down complex projects into manageable tasks.

### Smart Task Management
Track progress, manage dependencies, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

### Memory System
Maintain context across sessions and team members with an intelligent memory system.

### Feature-Based Development
Organize work into self-contained features, each with its own tasks, memory, and planning documents. This enables parallel development and better modularization.

### Validation & State Tracking
Ensure consistency and correctness with built-in validation rules.
